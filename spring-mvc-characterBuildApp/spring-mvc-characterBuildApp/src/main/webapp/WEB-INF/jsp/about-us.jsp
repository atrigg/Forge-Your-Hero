			<p class="lead">I've seen the magnetic power of a well designed character, as I'm sure you have as well. People connect with even the 
			smallest detail. How many of you spent hours designing the right character in a video game, role-playing game or event a design book or
			a graphic novel? I'm sure I'm not alone. The right design for a character can be the face of a series as well as a franchise. While under-
			appreciated, design is what draws people in. 'Forge Your Hero' is to help creators find that draw, or just make a kick ass looking character.
			Either way I hope you have fun in the process.

			<p class="lead">Enjoy your Forge!</p>
